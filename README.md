# Quack

Click on the 'Tekst zadatka.pdf' to read assignemnt's text in Croatian. Here is a link if you just want to quickly try the app: http://rp2.studenti.math.hr/~matonce/dz2/index.php?rt=quack (username: maja, password: maja).
The application was written in PHP and uses SQL queries. It was a homework for a college class that I have enrolled in.
